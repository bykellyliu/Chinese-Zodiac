	<h3>Personalities</h3>
	<p>
			People born in the year of the horse are extremely animated, active and energetic. 
		<br />
			Horses love to be in a crowd, and they can usually be seen in such occasions as concerts, theaters, meetings, sporting occasions, and parties. 
		
			With a deft sense of humor, horses are masters of repartee. They love to take center stage and delight audiences everywhere.
		<br />
			Sometimes, the horse is a little self-centered, but it doesn't mean that he will not be interested in any problems except his own.
		
			However, a horse person is really more cunning than intelligent, that is probably due to the fact that most horse people lack confidence.
