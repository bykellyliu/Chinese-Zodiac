	<h3>Personalities</h3>
	<p>
			People born in the year of the goat are mild mannered, pessimistic, shy, and sympathetic. Personality traits, such as creativity, dependability, intelligence, and calmness make them very charming to be with. 
		<br />	
			They are more comfortable when left alone or stay at home.
		
			Though they love to be in groups, they do not want to be the centred of attention.
		<br />
			They are reserved and quiet, most likely because they like spending much time in their thoughts. 
			
			Goats like to spend money on fashionable things that give them a first class appearance. 
		<br />	
			Although goats enjoy spending money on the finer things in life, they are not snobbish.
